			<h1>Writing</h1>
			<p> I have loved writing since I was younger. In middle school and high school, I was always the student who exceeded page limits on assignments and turned in long answers during exams. At Georgia Tech, I decided to pursue this passion to the fullest by joining several writing clubs. My first position started in the <em>Pioneer</em>, which is a newspaper in the Biomedical Engineering department. My articles have showcased a professor's minority initiative efforts, the BMES meeting, admission process for dental school, and biotechnology news. Through this club, I learned about the importance of teamwork and how the success of our publication depended on continuous communication and collaboration between different parties, including the photographers, writers, persons being interviewed for the content, article editors, layout editors, and the editor in chief. To see a complete list of articles I have published in the <em> Pioneer</em>, please see the link below.   </p>

			<p> I am also a writer for the <em>Tower Undergraduate Research Journal</em>, where I interview different professors and showcase their research through the News Briefs series. Due to the standards and quality of our publication, our organization was recently selected to have the issues archived at the Library of Congress!
