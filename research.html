				<h1>Research</h1>
				<p> Since August 2012, I have been an Undergraduate Research Assistant in Dr. Gilda Barabino's laboratory in the department of Biomedical Engineering. I have worked with several graduate student and post-doc mentors on various projects which have focused on studying bone and blood abnormalities in Sickle Cell Disease as well as making hydrogels for osteochondral tissue engineering applications.   </p>
