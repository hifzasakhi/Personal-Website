			<h1>About Me</h1>
			<p>Hello, my name is Hifza Sakhi. I am a Georgia native and the oldest of five siblings. I am currently a 4th year student, double majoring in Computer Science and Biomedical Engineering at the Georgia Institute of Technology.  Though I have participated in numerous acitivities at Georgia Tech, my favorite club is the Startup Exchange. I love learning about new coding languages through the programs in this organization, such as the Ruby Tutorials and Web Development sessions. I loved getting a good start in HTML/CSS through this organization and  am eagerly looking for an internship opportunity in Summer 2014 to apply my Web Development skills. Please feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions or have any opportunities for me. Thank you!   </p>
